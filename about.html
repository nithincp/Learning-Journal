        <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
        <p>Learning requires dedication and consistency, and I have developed a few strategies to stay committed on this journey. Firstly, I embrace a growth mindset, understanding that every challenge and setback is an opportunity for growth. This mindset helps me approach new subjects with curiosity and perseverance, even when faced with difficulties.
          <br />
        Secondly, I create a structured learning plan and set specific goals to guide my progress. By breaking down my learning objectives into manageable tasks, I can track my achievements and maintain a sense of momentum. Regularly reviewing and adjusting my goals keeps me motivated and ensures that I am continuously progressing.
