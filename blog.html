          The 100daysofcode challenge is an excellent way to kickstart your
          coding journey. It encourages you to code consistently for 100 days,
          thereby helping you develop a habit of learning and practicing coding
          regularly.

        <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
        <p>
          Learning requires dedication and consistency, and I have developed a
          few strategies to stay committed on this journey. Firstly, I embrace a
          growth mindset, understanding that every challenge and setback is an
          opportunity for growth. This mindset helps me approach new subjects
          with curiosity and perseverance, even when faced with difficulties.
          <br />
          <br />
          Secondly, I create a structured learning plan and set specific goals
          to guide my progress. By breaking down my learning objectives into
          manageable tasks, I can track my achievements and maintain a sense of
          momentum. Regularly reviewing and adjusting my goals keeps me
          motivated and ensures that I am continuously progressing.

        <h3>How I got started</h3>
        <p>
          My journey of continuous learning began with a simple curiosity to
          explore new subjects and gain practical skills. I started by
          identifying my areas of interest and passion. By focusing on topics
          that genuinely intrigued me, I found the motivation to delve deeper
          into each subject.
          <br />
          <br />
          To embark on this path, I began by leveraging various online learning
          platforms and resources. These platforms offered a wealth of courses
          and tutorials on diverse topics. I carefully selected courses aligned
          with my interests and goals, ensuring that they provided comprehensive
          content and expert guidance.
